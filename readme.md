Discord:
Create a discord account if you don't already have one.
Follow this guide to create a webhook: https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/platforms/how-to-get-started-with-discord-webhooks#how-do-i-add-a-webhook-to-discord

Once your webhook is created, copy the URL and paste in the webhook field in config.json

Save your config.json and you can run the script.

Running the script:
On Windows (CMD) or Mac (Terminal) cd to the directory where you downloaded the folder. Enter the command "npm i" and it will install all packages associated with project.

Once all packages are installed, run the script by entering "node server"

The server is now running locally and will wait for notifications.
